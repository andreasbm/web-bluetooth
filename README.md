# web-bluetooth

A cool showcase of how to interact with bluetooth devices on the web. Was create the 22nd of November 2017 as a part of the Web USB and Web Bluetooth Workshop by Lars Knudsen. For this workshop we used Nordic Thingy:52 for the sensors.

Go to [https://andreasbm.github.io/web-bluetooth/](https://andreasbm.github.io/web-bluetooth/) to see a demo of the game we created at the workshop. The goal of this game is to turn your device until the color of your player is the same as the target color. For each color you will have 30 seconds to find it.
